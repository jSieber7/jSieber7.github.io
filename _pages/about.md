Big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, what do all these big words mean? Are they buzzwords? Are these the words that completely disrupt industries and change the world we live in? While there are always those who overhype the latest technology boom (think the dot com bubble), there is no doubt that these technologies are beginning to rock the world. 

In the new world of self driving cars, cell phones tracking your every move, and politically charged twitter bots, it can be difficult to determine whether these new tools will be used to lift humanity up or be missused and abused by those with those in the driver seat. Petabytes upon petabytes of data are constantly being recorded and analyzed. Nowadays, some machines can even learn from simulated data without human intervention. Data and research serve as the fuel for the new world that is slowly but steadly emerging in the 21st century. 

I am an eternal student of the evergrowing number of techniques to use math, intuition, computer science, experience, and a hint of artistry to have a machine learn on its own. I enjoy working with large amounts of data and building tools to generate insights, automate human bound tasks, and explore the limits of reinforcement learning. I hold a degree in finance and master degree in Data Science from UNC Charlotte.
