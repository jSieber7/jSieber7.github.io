Big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, what do all these big words mean? Are they buzzwords simply propping up the data science bubble of hype? Are these the words that completely disrupt industries and change the world we live in?

In the new world of self driving cars, phones embedded with artificial intelligence, and politically charged twitter bots, it can be difficult to determine fact from fiction. One of the major reasons for the trend of 'smart' devices and advanced analytics is the explosion of data generation. Petabytes upon petabytes of data are constantly being recorded onto ever cheaper corporate hard drives. It turns out, data almost always has a story to tell and a bit of empirical advice to part with if you learn how to listen. And listen people do.

I am one among the many who study this data with statistical techniques, computer programs, and whatever contextual knowledge I can scrounge up. The beautiful thing about data analytics, is that there is an incredible amount of free data, professional software free of charge, and a new problem to solved. Anyone with enough patience and free time can participate. I aim to keep abreast of the current data science environment and clearly communicate the basics here on my blog.

I hold a degree in finance and am a current masters student at UNC Charlotte. I do have some MOOC certifications, although now I prefer learning through the more thorough method of books. My MOOC certifications are linked below. While I have not taken MOOC courses for SQL and R, I do have experience coding in these languages. In fact, I do enjoy coding in R more than Python (thanks to Hadley Wickham). I mostly program in R now unless there is a particular Python package or functionality I would like to use. And when dealing with large data, SQL is a necessity.
